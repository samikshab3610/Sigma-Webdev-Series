    <p><b>Artificial intelligence (AI)</b> refers to the capability of computational systems to perform tasks typically
        associated with human intelligence, such as learning, reasoning, problem-solving, perception, and
        decision-making. It is a field of research in computer science that develops and studies methods and software
        that enable machines to perceive their environment and use learning and intelligence to take actions that
        maximize their chances of achieving defined goals. <sub>[1]</sub> Such machines may be called AIs.</p>
    <p>High-profile applications of AI include advanced web search engines (e.g., Google Search); recommendation systems
        (used by YouTube, Amazon, and Netflix); virtual assistants (e.g., Google Assistant, Siri, and Alexa); autonomous
        vehicles (e.g., Waymo); generative and creative tools (e.g., ChatGPT and AI art); and superhuman play and
        analysis in strategy games (e.g., chess and Go). However, many AI applications are not perceived as AI: "A lot
        of cutting edge AI has filtered into general applications, often without being called AI because once something
        becomes useful enough and common enough it's not labeled AI anymore."<sub>[2][3]</sub><br>

        Various subfields of AI research are centered around particular goals and the use of particular tools. The
        traditional goals of AI research include learning, reasoning, knowledge representation, planning, natural
        language processing, perception, and support for robotics.[a] General intelligence—the ability to complete any
        task performed by a human on an at least equal level—is among the field's long-term goals. <sub>[4]</sub> To
        reach these goals, AI researchers have adapted and integrated a wide range of techniques, including search and mathematical
        optimization, formal logic, artificial neural networks, and methods based on statistics, operations research,
        and economics.[b] AI also draws upon psychology, linguistics, philosophy, neuroscience, and other fields.
        <sub>[5]</sub><br>

        Artificial intelligence was founded as an academic discipline in 1956, <sub>[6]</sub> and the field went through
        multiple cycles of optimism throughout its history, <sub>[7][8]</sub> followed by periods of disappointment and loss of
        funding, known as AI winters. <sub>[9][10]</sub> Funding and interest vastly increased after 2012 when deep learning  outperformed
        previous AI techniques.[11] This growth accelerated further after 2017 with the transformer architecture,[12]
        and by the early 2020s many billions of dollars were being invested in AI and the field experienced rapid
        ongoing progress in what has become known as the AI boom. The emergence of advanced generative AI in the midst
        of the AI boom and its ability to create and modify content exposed several unintended consequences and harms in
        the present and raised concerns about the risks of AI and its long-term effects in the future, prompting
        discussions about regulatory policies to ensure the safety and benefits of the technology.</p>

    <h3><b>Goals</b></h3>
    <hr>
    <p>The general problem of simulating (or creating) intelligence has been broken into subproblems. These consist of
        particular traits or capabilities that researchers expect an intelligent system to display. The traits described
        below have received the most attention and cover the scope of AI research. <sub>[a]</sub>

        <h4><b>Reasoning and problem-solving</b></h4>
        Early researchers developed algorithms that imitated step-by-step reasoning that humans use when they solve
        puzzles or make logical deductions. <sub>[13]</sub> By the late 1980s and 1990s, methods were developed for dealing with
        uncertain or incomplete information, employing concepts from probability and economics. <sub>[14]</sub><br>

        Many of these algorithms are insufficient for solving large reasoning problems because they experience a
        "combinatorial explosion": They become exponentially slower as the problems grow. <sub>[15]</sub> Even humans rarely use the
        step-by-step deduction that early AI research could model. They solve most of their problems using fast,
        intuitive judgments.[16] Accurate and efficient reasoning is an unsolved problem.</p><br><hr>
